#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/B4VuAg-6fTk
#### Description:

Job Searcher offers users a quick and effective way to look for employment prospects by utilizing the RAPID API jSearch. When the user inputs their desired location and job title, the software then provides a list of pertinent job openings that match the user's input using the RAPID API jSearch.

The application verifies against the .csv file containing previously saved job postings to make sure the user is not shown duplicate possibilities and also confirms that the deadline for posting a job is not past due. The application saves the job in the.csv file for future use if it is distinct and not past due. 

After it is done searching and filtering the job postings, it writes out the unique job possibilities to the terminal.
A list of the job title and application URLs under each company is presented, and the job openings are arranged by company name.
With this, users will find it simpler to rapidly find and apply to job openings that match their credentials and preferences as a result.

Ultimately, Job Searcher reduces the possibility of duplicates and out-of-date job posts while offering users a straightforward and efficient approach to look for employment prospects.
