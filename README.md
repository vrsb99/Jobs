#### Description:

Job Searcher offers users a quick and effective way to look for employment prospects by utilizing the RAPID API jSearch. When the user inputs their desired location and job title, the software then provides a list of pertinent job openings that match the user's input using the RAPID API jSearch.

The application verifies against the .csv file containing previously saved job postings to make sure the user is not shown duplicate possibilities and also confirms that the deadline for posting a job is not past due. The application saves the job in the.csv file for future use if it is distinct and not past due. 

After it is done searching and filtering the job postings, it writes out the unique job possibilities to the terminal.
A list of the job title and application URLs under each company is presented, and the job openings are arranged by company name.
With this, users will find it simpler to rapidly find and apply to job openings that match their credentials and preferences as a result.

Another benefit of using Job Searcher is that it saves users time by automating the job search process. Instead of manually searching for job postings on multiple job boards and company websites, users can simply enter their search criteria and let Job Searcher do the rest. This not only saves time but also eliminates the frustration of having to sift through irrelevant job postings.

Ultimately, Job Searcher reduces the possibility of duplicates and out-of-date job posts while offering users a straightforward and efficient approach to look for employment prospects. Its features, including the ability to eliminate duplicates, save searches, that make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to streamline their job search process.
